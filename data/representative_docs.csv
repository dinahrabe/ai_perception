3,"Even if experts solve the engineering problem of aligning AI with select human values, further political concerns remain."
3,"“This type of oversight makes me worried that their stated commitment to the other important values and goals – like taking seriously creating AI to serve the ‘collective needs of humanity’ – is also empty PR spin and this will be nothing more than a vanity project for those attached to it,” she wrote in an email."
3,"Neither, says Lanier: artificial intelligence is something we could never know, by definition, if we had attained it."
3,"From this amazing text, Russell pulled one dramatic quote: “Once the machine thinking method had started, it would not take long to outstrip our feeble powers."
3,Russell believes that our current approach to designing intelligent machines is fundamentally misguided – and would indeed lead to dystopian outcomes if the visions of its evangelists ever came to fruition.
3,"Russell, a pioneer in machine intelligence, here considers the increasingly fashionable subject of what to do if a superintelligent AI is created and then takes over the world – or rather, how to stop that from happening."
3,"First, you have to deal with the question: “Ethics??"
3,“But it depends what your ethical theory is.

3,"Illustration: Lehel Kovács/The Observer   “Imagine,” he says, “if the Nazis had won the second world war, held on to power for a few hundred years, established a world government and then got to the point of developing AGI [artificial general intelligence], then you could have a future that would be guided and controlled by Nazi ideology for ever.” The critical point in this analogy is not so much the Nazis, who represent humanity’s potential for doing ill, but AGI."
3,"Everything he says seems reasonable, not particularly hubristic, and who knows: perhaps AGI will remain under our control."
3,"No one can be certain that AGI is achievable and, if it is, when it will be achieved, but most scientists working in the field think that it will happen."
3,"In a world suffused with gloom, is the WTA project not wildly utopian, I ask Dr Bostrom, who is the association's principal spokesperson and teaches at Oxford University."
3,"An earlier version said that an open letter signed by eminent scientists was a direct result of Bostrom’s book, rather than a coincidence."
3,"Some are more sensible than others, but it is really quite random.” Bostrom’s passion is to attempt to apply some maths to that randomness."
3,This is illustrated by Bostrom’s famous “paperclip problem”.
3,"“One thing it would do is make sure that humans didn’t switch it off, because then there would be fewer paperclips,” explains Nick Bostrom in Salon magazine."
3,"As it continues its noble work of turning everything into paperclips, it decides, quite logically, to eradicate anything that is not a paperclip, including humans, in order to create more space."
3,Boring!!!
3,It's boring.
3,Sir Boring Hack to you.
3,"And if a game boasts that its computer-controlled characters use ""advanced artificial intelligence"" it really means that they too are looking for patterns – so vary your tactics as much as possible."
3,Even now they have this very simple artificial intelligence in games that seems to engage people.
3,"His AI-driven characters can help the player on their quest, but they will not force users down any pre-determined paths, as menu-driven systems do."
3,"We need great, animating missions for the economy, such as decarbonisation or good ageing, which give purpose to industrial strategy."
3,"The point about industrial strategies, surely, is that governments have to stick with them."
3,Labour should draw important policy lessons from this for industrial strategy.
3,"So, if on Alpha Centauri or in the Orion system, there are ""intelligences as great as man's, and yet as mortal"" they have not been here."
3,"The overall impression is that society in general seems to recognise intelligence when it sees it, even if it is a bit inconsistent."
3,What makes human intelligence work with all its fallibility is its interaction with others and with the wider world.
3,"So far, the strategy for technology companies has been to deal with the ethical impact of their products retrospectively."
3,We’re rapidly traversing technological and ethical ground that nobody has covered before.
3,The discussion around ethics and regulation in technology needs to expand to include more existential questions.
3,“It’s just not possible to mitigate all the risk.
3,"He agrees but says that he has tried to present his modelling in as calm and rational a fashion as possible, making sure to take into account all the evidence that suggests the risks are not large."
3,"As Carys Roberts, the author of the IPPR report, tells me: “We don’t even talk about risks in this area, because there are so many different factors."
3,"If you are playing someone living, it is a different type of judgment."
3,But the most important part of all; I would never judge you.

3,"AI is at a “tipping point”, she adds, burrowing its way further and further into our lives."
3,"But there was consensus that developments in artificial intelligence will have a huge impact on future employment, with growing numbers of jobs reliant on human characteristics artificial intelligence can’t replicate, such as caring and empathy, and creativity and imagination."
3,Opinion is divided on the likely impact of the artificial intelligence revolution on jobs.
3,"Advances in artificial intelligence are already disrupting various industries, with predictions that machines will one day replace humans in the recruitment process."
3,Morality is for wimps.
3,We reasoned that people who stick to certain moral rules—even when it might bring about worse consequences - would be preferred as social partners.
3,"In much the same way, stars such as Gloria Swanson and Clara Bow were faced with morality clauses in their contracts."
3,Elon Musk caused a Twitter storm over his fears about how artificial intelligence (AI) could soon assume control of the internet.
3,"We need to make decisions today choosing which of these futures we want.” Musk, one of the signatories of the open letter, has repeatedly warned for the need for pro-active regulation of AI, calling it humanity’s biggest existential threat, but while AI’s destructive potential is considered by some to be vast it is also thought be distant."
3,"“This may seem trite,” he told the audience, “but I honestly think tunnels should be given a lot more consideration.” Alongside the future of travel, Musk elaborated on his belief that humanity will be the architect of its own demise in the form of super-intelligent artificial intelligence."
3,"After a year or so, Demon had between 2,000 and 3,000 users, but they weren't always clear why they had signed up: it was as if they had sensed the direction of the future, in some inchoate fashion, but hadn't thought things through any further than that."
3,The demon might itself be identified with Satan (see line four).
3,"“In all those stories where there’s the guy with the pentagram and the holy water, it’s like – yeah, he’s sure he can control the demon."
3,Summer 2018 was a fertile time for Musk.
3,"But, on the grounds that one can never be sure with Musk, it seemed worth exploring further before calling for the men in white coats."
3,"But the videos suggest that plenty of people, including both Musk and his wife, are going hands-free."
3,"Their relationship comes to a kind of crisis when she, yearning for a physical dimension to their relationship, suggests a ""surrogate"": a woman she has (somehow) found on the web who is willing to have sex with Theodore on her behalf, with miniature cameras and microphones on her body so Samantha can experience their love to the fullest."
3,"Since the premise of the film is a romance between Theodore and Samantha, it's easy to interpret the scene with that end in mind."
3,"It can also be seen as a comment on the NSA debate, with Samantha gleefully rifling through Theodore's emails."
3,Now comes news that octopuses have been building their own cities down there.
3,So octopuses represent an entirely distinct evolutionary path to making a mind – and how different it looks!
3,"Philosopher Peter Godfrey-Smith says that the octopus is “probably the closest we will come to meeting an intelligent alien.” Octopuses interact with us, apparently with neither fear nor aggression."
3,"Photograph: Anna Gordon   Baroness Olly Grender, member of the Lords select committee on AI, which published a report in April 2017 about the UK’s readiness to embrace this technology, agreed there is a need to improve its understanding in the civil service, and pointed to the GovTech Catalyst challenge, which is investing £20m over three years to encourage tech firms to help fix public sector challenges."
3,"In 2017, the UK government recommended creating an industry-funded AI master’s programme."
3,"Of course, the EU is not perfect but it is far better to be on the inside, making it work  professor David HunterRichmond, North Yorkshire • Larry Elliott writes that “the UK is one of the world leaders in artificial intelligence and could seize a competitive advantage once it can set its own regulations”."

3,"“And he now appears to be opportunistically seeking to inflict harm on Twitter, its customers and its shareholders.” All this is doubtless music to the ears of Elon Musk’s lawyers as they struggle to find a way for their client to escape from his expensively misguided bid to buy Twitter."
3,"Elon Musk withdrew his $44bn bid to buy Twitter on Friday after a months-long saga that rankled investors and shook the market, kicking off what may be a long legal battle with the company."
3,They thought that EVs should just be cars with electric motors; Musk’s idea was that they should be software on wheels.

3,"Only with electricity and computer power has the sophistication of these exquisite automata been bested, and even then it has taken a considerable length of time."
3,But just why are automatons so attractive?
3,"Autofac is a prophetic parable set in a war-ruined US city of the near future, where the inhabitants find themselves in a struggle of wits with a sinister AI-powered corporate entity as ruthless as it is faceless."
3,This is borne out by a recent study that asked what people would do in various iterations of the trolley problem.
3,"Watch a trailer for Trolley Problem, Inc."
3,Yet the trolley problem and reality are now on their own collision course.

3,Should we be trying to build robots with the capacity for moral judgment?
3,"Regardless of what decisions a robot would make, the way robots make decisions - by making calculations - is something people find untrustworthy in the context of morality."
3,"So when considering, for example, sex robots, we should expect hatred, antagonism, and judgement."
3,"Musk had grown angry after the caver ridiculed him over his plans to rescue a team of young footballers from a cave system in Thailand, baselessly calling Unsworth a “pedo guy” in a tweet to Musk’s then 22 million followers."
3,"“It was wrong and insulting, and so I insulted him back.” Unsworth, a British national who lives in Thailand, was among the first divers to reach the scene of the boys’ disappearance."
3,Musk also alleged in another baseless allegation that Unsworth was a “child rapist” in an email to a BuzzFeed reporter.
3,"While businesses search for ways to survive and thrive through this latest industrial revolution, what can the government do?"
3,Some sectors are well on their way.
3,The sector is woefully under-resourced and there’s a rapidly expanding user base.
3,Related: Explain it to me quickly: did Elon Musk and Grimes really name their baby X Æ A-12?
3,There was speculation that Æ referred to the ligature Ash.
3,"X Æ A-12 Musk— Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 5, 2020  Is this … real?"
3,BBOXX and its rivals use mobile money to charge customers a monthly fee for the use of mini solar panels and ultra-efficient lighting strips.
3,"The latest equity investment in Octopus backs its founder Greg Jackson’s plan to bring a “digital revolution” to the energy industry, and will help fund the company’s global expansion target of reaching 100 million worldwide customers."
3,"Mansoor Hamayun, BBOXX’s chief executive and co-founder, said Mitsubishi’s “extensive reach” and “technological expertise” would help the company to supply more people living without access to modern utilities and services."
3,The Musk Foundation suddenly had to find a home for millions of dollars.
3,"Musk launched his foundation in 2001, together with his younger brother Kimbal, who would serve as the organization’s secretary and treasurer."
3,"Photograph: Neilson Barnard/Getty Images for New York Times   In those early days, the foundation made small, uncontroversial donations to Musk’s alma maters in South Africa and the US, to other educational charities, space societies and children’s hospitals such as the Seattle Children’s Hospital and the Children’s Hospital of Los Angeles."
3,"Grimes was deified like a pop star, and there was a triumph-of-the-weird will to see her become one   The inescapable attention frustrated Boucher, though in a sense she was her own worst enemy."
3,"I want to be in a situation like I am now where my reputation is at an all-time low and I can still make sick-ass fucking music because I don’t rely on anybody.”   Grimes and i_o: Violence – video  Boucher has recently seemed at a loss to regain control over her career, and naive about her role in its dissolution."
3,"Napoleon had great image branding.” Given that her style and hair colour changed in every photo, Boucher disrupted the possibility of ever solidifying into the kind of stable pop silhouette connoted by either bicorne hat or cone bra."
3,The contrast between that ambition and what has been happening in the past 10 years is too stark to be ignored.
3,"That’s a firm cross through ambition No 1, then."
3,"""That's a bold ambition, because we don't know."
3,"In high-stakes cases they saw an ongoing need for a “human in the loop”, either taking key decisions with the machine’s help, or in an oversight role."
3,We insist there is always a human in the loop.
3,"""Increasingly [the manufacturers] are talking about the 'man on the loop', where one person can control a swarm of robots."
3,What is unique about the concept of a moral crumple zone is that it highlights how structural features of a system and the media’s portrayal of accidents may inadvertently take advantage of human operators (and their tendency to become “liability sponges”) to fill the gaps in accountability that may arise in the context of new and complex systems.” This all aligns nicely with one of the most pernicious aspects of our time: the subliminal tendency to assign more credibility to supposedly “smart” machines than to humans.
3,"By doing this, the zone protects the most important part of the car – the cell containing the driver and passengers."
3,"(If you doubt the effectiveness of crumple zones, by the way, a video made some years ago by the Fifth Gear TV programme makes interesting viewing.)"
3,"Amazon is leaving the haircuts and highlights to the professionals with the salon manned by Neville Hair & Beauty, an independent salon based in the capital."
3,The permanent salon will initially be road-tested by Amazon staff ahead of opening up to the public for appointments “in the coming weeks”.
3,Amazon has announced a surprise move into the world of hairdressing with the opening of a hi-tech hair salon in London that boasts special mirrors able to show customers how they would look with a different hair colour before they take the plunge.
3,"Spike Jonze’s wonderful Her imagined a geeky indie stereotype, Joaquin Phoenix’s Theodore Twombly, falling in love with his operating system, Scarlett Johansson’s Samantha, only to discover that his perky incorporeal paramour has been carrying out techno-romances with several thousand other human lovers."
3,"In Spike Jonze’s new movie Her, Joaquin Phoenix is an introverted writer on the verge of divorce who falls in love with his computer’s intelligent operating system."
3,"In recent years we’ve had two very good films about artificial intelligence: In Spike Jonze’s Her, a goofy Joaquin Phoenix twiddles his way into an idyllic relationship with his charming operating system, voiced by Scarlett Johansson."
3,But this week there’s another reason why Lisbon has been thrown into the spotlight – Web Summit.
3,Open a magazine and there’ll be yet another travel feature praising the Portuguese capital.
3,"Mundo Desportivo of Lisbon put it another way: ""It was inevitable."
3,So the challenge we will one day face is whether we can design superintelligent machines that are better behaved.
3,"This mattered little in the age of Plato or Descartes, because in those days the only place you could create superintelligences was in your imagination."
3,But what is superintelligence?
3,Google scientists have created a computer program that uses basic reasoning to learn to navigate the London Underground system by itself.
3,"One little project there was called Google Brain, which focused on AI."
3,"There are early examples at places such as Google’s AI subsidiary, DeepMind, of computers self-learning, adapting through trial and error."
3,"Though the most ambitious features have yet to be built into Squirrel AI’s system, the company already claims to have achieved impressive results."
3,This data is then used to train the algorithms of the “thinking” part of the Squirrel AI system.
3,Squirrel AI is part of this new generation of education start-ups.
3,"Surprisingly, listening to classical music and drinking orange juice actually resulted in a small drop in IQ."
3,"After all, it has to be admitted, IQ is a very narrow, contrived measure of intelligence."
3,Some people also believe that scoring highly on an IQ test is evidence that you can score highly on an IQ test and that’s about it.
3,"But first, the co-founder of the Singularity University, Peter Diamandis, gives us our instructions for the day."
3,The Singularity University's USP and founding ideology is based on doing better.
3,"Jim Gianopulos, the chairman of Fox Filmed Entertainment, went on a Singularity University course, and has since become evangelical about it."
3,"If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that."
3,"If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that."
3,"If I had to guess at what our biggest existential threat is, it’s probably that”."
3,"But they should be used only for morally justified missions, in pursuit of a just cause."
3,So war made good sense because you could enrich yourself by waging war against your neighbours.
3,"But if a military action is morally justified, we are also morally bound to ensure that it is carried out with as little harm to innocent people as possible."
3,How do we make autonomous technological systems safe and ethical?
3,"Embodied as robots, deep-learning AI is poised to begin to move and work among us – in the form of service, transportation, medical and military robots."
3,"The government also needs to make sure that any policy reflects the values and concerns of the British public.” Chief executive of the Big Innovation Centre, Birgitte Andersen, said there should be an ethics board established to produce standards that the companies developing autonomous vehicles need to abide by."
3,"“One can imagine equipping in-game characters with an entire cognitive architecture including short- and long-term memory, drives and desires, attention, cognition, and even emotions,” says Graepel."
3,"Really though, this is already happening in video games, where non-player characters are becoming ever more complex, both in terms of visual representation and “intelligence”."
3,"Experimental indie titles like Prom Week and Facade have investigated the idea of non-player characters with simulated emotional lives, and with the Versu interactive story platform, Richard Evans and Emily Short are producing AI agents capable of highly nuanced social interactions."
3,But there's not a scintilla of doubt in Kurzweil's mind about this.
3,But Kurzweil is anything but ordinary.
3,"But then, it's Kurzweil's single-mindedness that's been the foundation of his success, that made him his first fortune when he was still a teenager, and that shows no sign of letting up."
13,"Still, sharing data has proved more contentious amid concerns about privacy."
13,Almost four in five respondents to a 2012 Demos poll said their primary concern around personal data was that companies would use it without their permission - coming in just above worries about companies losing user data.
13,"The MAX doesn’t collect any data, Hanlon tells me."
13,"AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law."
13,"AI has the potential to make organisations more effective and efficient, but the technology raises serious issues of ethics, governance, privacy and law."
13,"On a practical level, the institute’s work will inform law, regulation and governance in AI."
13,"· The Spy in the Coffee Machine: The End of Privacy as We Know It by Kieron O'Hara and Nigel Shadbolt (Oneworld Publications, £)"
13,"While privacy is a problem, a newer issue is 'propensity'."
13,Will it take privacy seriously going forward?
13,"The General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), which came into force on 25 May 2018, replaced the patchwork of national data protection laws across the EU with a unified system that greatly increased the fines regulators could issue, strengthened the requirements for consent to data processing, and created a new pan-European data regulator called the European Data Protection Board."
13,"We have also taken extra steps given the implementation of the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR), in order to ensure our compliance with the regulation."
13,"Not what we were promised last year, when the European Union’s General Data Protection Regulation, commonly known as the GDPR, came into effect."
13,"According to a partially declassified EDPS inspection report obtained under freedom of information laws, “routine checks” by Europol of migrants crossing EU borders “are not allowed” as there is “no legal basis” for such a programme."
13,"But the full contents of what it holds are unknown, in part because of the haphazard way that EDPS found Europol to be treating data."
13,"“It’s shocking how easily police share information over borders, and it’s terrifying how difficult it is to manage to delete yourself from these lists.” * * * Concerns over Europol’s treatment of sensitive data prompted the watchdog to raise its own questions in 2019."
13,"A map of Europe showing different types of technology in place at borders  The EU is central to the push towards using technology on its borders, whether it has been bought by the EU’s border force, Frontex, or financed for member states through EU sources, such as its internal security fund or Horizon 2020, a project to drive innovation."
13,The EDF is modelled on the security component of the EU’s longstanding civilian research programme now called Horizon Europe.
13,"However, this could change in a few years' time with the European Union set to include security as a priority area in its Framework programme for research."
13,But it's nevertheless effective.
13,But its advocates claim it is highly effective.
13,"Crude, but effective."
13,"Rather than using the personal information of voters (furnished by the likes of Cambridge Analytica) for manipulation, we plan to use data-intensive platforms to boost political participation and make politicians more accountable."
13,"I’d actually never given much thought to how personal data could be used to influence political perceptions, ultimately influencing the outcome of elections across the continent."
13,We also need to understand better how political campaigns purchase and use our personal information – and how technology platforms market the data.
18,But it does have these features that you can train up a machine-learning algorithm.
18,"Machine learning is a much more modern approach to solving the AI problem where we are coming from the bottom up rather than top down, so we are saying, well, let’s define these really crisp, well-defined, sub-problems, like classifying a handwritten digit as being either a one or two, and then use novel techniques within statistics and optimisation to create an algorithm that can improve its performance over time."
18,The method of machine learning used in the study learned from data alone.
18,"It could be open to accusations of bias, especially once the algorithm takes over from the human input."
18,"Bias doesn’t require malice to become harm, and unlike a human being, we can’t easily ask an algorithmic gatekeeper to explain its decision."
18,"Also on the positive side, algorithms aren't much for drama, counter-espionage or leaking."
18,"Good history, on the other hand, is based on deep learning."
18,"The belief that everything worthwhile can be measured and then managed is far more damaging to humanity than the threat of artificial intelligence on its own, but “deep learning” techniques are increasingly deployed in the service of this belief."
18,The problem is similar: there are a lot of Newcomens in the world of deep learning.
18,The study is yet another reminder that AI often comes with baked-in biases.
18,“People expected AI to be unbiased; that’s just wrong.
18,"“We collect data from our crowd of contractors in an effort to take the bias out of AI,” she said."
18,Research has already shown that AI programs are picking up deeply-ingrained race and gender prejudices.
18,"We talk about the racial bias of artificial intelligence, debate the role of the professional managerial class, share pictures of our outfits."
18,The industry’s serious diversity problem is partly to blame for AIs that discriminate against women and minorities.
18,It’s really a very different thing from subjectivity or bias.
18,That’s a potential source of bias.
18,What about bias?
18,"There's something called The Pattern, too, but that's so secret I can't tell you what it is, otherwise all my own cells would crystallise."
18,Are we really just a sum of repeating patterns?
18,And so you kind of go through those cyclic patterns.
18,"The race to buy the human brains behind deep learning machines >> Businessweek  ""DeepMind is bona fide in terms of its research capabilities and depth,"" says Peter Lee, who heads Microsoft Research."
18,"“My challenge to the likes of Google’s DeepMind is to invent a deep learning system that can explain itself,” Winfield said."
18,"Machine learning can help you to build a tool that is extremely fast.” DeepMind was not the only group that was attempting to develop such tools, but it was currently leading the field, he added."
18,“We should distinguish between AI and machine learning.
18,Machine learning and the concept of artificial intelligence have been with us a long time.
18,It’s instead becoming an article of faith that “artificial intelligence” or “machine learning” will learn to spot this stuff and act.
18,Scandal erupts.
18,You only have to think of the Thalidomide scandal to realise why we don’t allow that kind of thing.
18,There’s a final parallel to draw with the VW scandal.
18,"The immigration system needs to be rebuilt from the ground up to monitor such bias and to root it out.” In their submission to the high court, JWCI and the technology justice campaign group Foxglove said the algorithm created three channels for applicants, including a so-called “fast lane” that would lead to “speedy boarding for white people” from the most favoured countries in the system."
18,"Over  million visitor visas were granted, for leisure, study or business, an increase of 8% in the past year.” In its legal action the JCWI is demanding all the technical details that drive the streaming tool be revealed, along with further information such as case-working targets in each of the three categories, and if there have been any complaints about the deployment of the algorithm."
18,"The charity the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI) and the digital rights group Foxglove launched a legal challenge against the system, which was scrapped before a case went to court."
18,"Under the proposed “global digital platform” model, applications for visas would be made online, and the government wants 90% – in particular short-term and simple applications – to be assessed and decided automatically, without any human involvement."
18,Visa services now fall under the ambit of the newly established Department of Home Affairs.
18,The department’s first request for expressions of interest to the market is to create the “global digital platform” for handling visa applications and approvals.
18,"While Silicon Valley relies on H1B to bring in skilled foreign workers, the immigration scheme has also been exploited in a way that drives down wages and in some cases displaces American jobs, said Daniel Costa, of the Economic Policy Institute."
18,"Some fear he could be driving the effort to reform the program for H-1B workers, the majority of whom are from India."
18,"“We are in this horrible limbo of anticipating the worst.” 
Gurudatt Bhobe, co-founder at SupplyAI, said he tries not to dwell on the unknown: “I’d rather not let it affect me.” But both founders admitted they were worried H-1B changes could force the company to consider relocating to Canada or moving most of the operation to India even though the firm’s technology adoption and market is in the US."

22,"Interestingly, he pointed out that it would have been a simple task to have engineered the enigma machine to prevent it being able to send a new message until, and unless, it was re-set."
22,He was chemically castrated and two years later died from cyanide poisoning in an apparent suicide.
22,"The coroner's verdict was suicide, though Turing's mother believed he had accidentally ingested cyanide after a chemistry experiment."
22,He was found dead by his cleaner on 8 June 1954.

24,"Some places to start might be some of the groups organised around women in games – for example IGDA Women in Games special interest group, Dames making Games or Women in games International."
24,"Considering that the games industry is currently heavily dominated by men, do you have any extra advice for young women looking to get into making games, either in the indie or mainstream sectors?"
24,"The underlying cause of all those issues is the insidious persistence of gender roles, and our expectations of how both men and women will conform to outdated stereotypes."
24,"“Women are expected to be collegial and friendly and supportive and not too pushy,” says Krupinska."
24,"It’s a gender thing.” In Kirkintilloch, the kettle is on and the men are showing off their work."
24,"As AI developers begin to explore – and exploit – the realm of human emotions, it brings a host of gender-related issues to the fore."
24,"“Traditional ‘female’ skills are so important to AI, whether it’s nurturing, mothering, caring, problem-solving, diplomacy, or critical thinking skills."
24,"Because only 22% of the people building AI right now are female, making sure that the technology we interact with is not sexist, racist or homophobic is incredibly important."
24,Why are the stem subjects important?

25,And on Thursday the Bank of England’s chief economist warned that this wave of automation is threatening skilled roles.
25,"It indeed seems possible that, for the first time since the dawn of the Industrial Revolution, technology will eliminate jobs faster than it creates new ones."
25,"GC To be clear, I take seriously the possibility that technology may for the first time be reducing total employment rather than increasing it and the first two chapters of my new book are all about that."
25,It is not simply that the technology is causing jobs to be lost.
25,We are in the middle of a fourth industrial revolution.

33,"Away from the fMRI scanner, psychologists and cognitive scientists - those who study the software that runs on the brain's hardware - have made great progress in the modelling of human thought processes."
33,What about the idea that our brains do computations?
33,Related: Can a brain scan uncover your morals?
33,"But while judges and juries must decide whether a person meant to break the law or not, it has never been clear whether the legal distinctions of knowingly committing a crime, versus doing so through reckless behaviour, are a true reflection of how the brain works."
33,"With more brain images from people committing mock crimes, it should be possible to work out which areas of the brain are involved, and how differences in development, the drugs people take, and mental disorders, change brain activity patterns."
33,"Still missing, though, in many ways the single most important program of all: the kernel."
33,"Still missing, though, in many ways the single most important program of all: the kernel."
33,"A microkernel is a kernel that takes the idea of a small, central adjudicating piece of software to its logical conclusion; it makes all the other housekeeping tasks normally found in a kernel into programs that are controlled just like end-user applications such as word processing and spreadsheets."
33,"Photograph: PR   I put these questions to Tan Le at a developer event in San Francisco in February where she was unveiling a lightweight version of the Epoc, called Insight, comprising just five EEG sensors instead of 14."
33,I was keen to understand precisely how the Epoc headset and their brain-control interface (BCI) worked and whether the system had been tested in a laboratory setting.
33,"Designed by Emotiv Systems, a Californian neuroengineering company, the Epoc headset purports to give users the power to control objects with their thoughts and was a succès fou on Kickstarter, where users stumped up $ to fund its development – 16 times Emotiv's original target."
40,"“Words are organised by semantic family in a logical sequence,” De Ménibus explains."
40,It helps to understand how words work.
40,At first the system spat out nonsense sentences.
40,To create a system capable of typing one hundred words per minute – five times faster than you can type on a smartphone – straight from your brain.
40,"""We've always seen it as being about language rather than text input specifically – that's just the first problem we've tried to fix with our technology and approach."
40,"This contrasts with other NLP tasks, where performance improves with model size."
40,Those who are working at the sharper end of the translation models tend to be slightly more cautionary about that future.
40,"“That’s something humans might not so easily pick up on,” said Kaminski – although a translation device might have difficulty spotting that, too."
40,It is the same sort of consideration with Google Translate.
40,"With some of the people in power at the moment, you can’t pick the endgame."
40,"“Board games at our place don’t end when the game ends, they end when Ralph decides it’s time to stop,” explains co-founder James Marsden."
40,The endgame is likely to get better.
40,"Karel Čapek’s 1921 science-fiction play, , which is credited with introducing the word to the English language, depicts a cyborg labour force that rebels against its human masters, leading to the extinction of the human race."
40,Karel Čapek’s 1920 play RUR (Rossum’s Universal Robots) gave us the word (meaning “labourer” in Czech).
40,"It was in just such a tale, written by the Czech playwright Karel Capek in 1920, that the word ""robot"" first appeared, derived from the Czech robota, meaning ""forced labour""."
40,"The technology is used widely, to provide speech and face recognition, language translation, and personal recommendations on music, film and shopping sites."

40,"“Although these results tell the story of one leadership election, the problem of gendered language is universal,” says MacIntyre."
40,"“Language itself contains recoverable and accurate imprints of our historic biases,” they write, “whether these are morally neutral as towards insects or flowers, problematic as towards race or gender, or even simply veridical, reflecting the status quo for the distribution of gender with respect to careers or first names.” And of course these hidden biases are inevitably captured by machine learning."
40,It was recently revealed that Google Translate was producing sexist results by automatically matching male pronouns to certain professions and traits.
40,"“I’m friends with most of these people, but there is that competitive element you need to have.”  Congratulations to #David #Eldar, 2017 #Scrabble champion."
40,"Related: Double letter flaw: champion Scrabble player banned amid cheating furore   Richards did not play Scrabble until he was 28, after his mother became frustrated that his photographic memory was rendering their card games a foregone conclusion."
40,"To wit, he won the 2015 francophone world Scrabble championships despite not speaking a word of French, having memorised the entire French Scrabble dictionary in nine weeks."
40,■ In 2006 The Simpsons featured a male and female Golem in “You Gotta Know When to Golem”.
40,And then “Old Golem became a thing of the past in minutes.”    Shamira Turner – and Golem – in 1927’s Golem.
40,"Place your order,” “Move with the times or you’ll be left behind.” Not long after Robert comes to love Golem, the clay man is updated to a figure who is quicker, shinier and far more agile: Golem II."
40,"There have been combinations along these lines before, but none work quite like Scrolls does – playing it is more akin to a turn-based strategy game where you're positioning an army, rather than simply amassing troops."
40,Scrolls is a difficult game to pin down.
40,"Scrolls has resources but no resource cards, instead letting you sacrifice one Scroll per turn for either a permanent increase in your resource pool, or two more Scrolls."
40,Still playable?
40,Still playable?
40,"Pretty good actually, and certainly playable enough to keep me interested for a few hours yesterday afternoon."
42,"Hey, come on, they say, we’re doing everything we can to tune the machines to cut out the evil stuff!"
42,I have argued that we should be more timid and modest about our achievements and let others decide how clever or sentient our machines really are.
42,Machines cannot think like humans.
